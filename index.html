                <p>
                   Dr. Yifeng Gao is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. He received his Ph.D. degree of Computer Science, George Mason University in 2021. He previously recieved a M.S. degree in Computer Engineering from StonyBrook University in 2013. and a B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Xidian University in 2012.
